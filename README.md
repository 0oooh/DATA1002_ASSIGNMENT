1. Introduction:
Topic / Question Description:
  Our group decided to research the factors influencing car crashes in Australia from 2017 to 2021. Each
group member focused on researching car crash data in different states in Australia. Nowadays,
automobile accidents are among the most frequent incidents that threaten peopleâ€™s daily lives. In
Australia, there are an average of 4.8 fatal accidents per day. By researching the crash data, people can
better understand the causes of accidents, which can help them take preventive measures.

Stakeholders:
  The key stakeholders for this data include the government, citizens, and car-related companies. For the
government, crash data can be used to improve road systems and address specific issues that lead to
accidents. For example, if data shows that many accidents occur during holiday seasons, the government
can deploy more traffic police during those times to prevent them. Additionally, if accidents frequently
occur on a specific road, the government can investigate whether the road has physical or systemic issues,
leading to potential infrastructure improvements.
  For citizens, the data can help them understand the causes of accidents and take preventive measures. For
instance, if the data reveals that many accidents happen during snowy weather, citizens might choose to
use snow tires in such conditions, which can reduce the risk of accidents.
For car-related companies, crash data can provide valuable insights into areas where vehicle safety can be
improved. Understanding the conditions under which accidents most frequently occur allows companies
to enhance both hardware and software for better performance in those situations. For example,
autonomous car companies like Tesla could use this data to improve their self-driving software through
machine learning, making their vehicles safer in specific scenarios.

Data Overview:
  The dataset we used for our analysis includes records of car crashes in Australia from as early as 1998 to
2023. The dataset consists of thousands of records sourced from various platforms like Kaggle,
government transport data websites, and state government websites. Each dataset includes key variables
such as weather conditions, the number of accidents, and the time of accidents in non-cleaned format.
These datasets are suitable for our research as they provide the necessary information to identify trends
and factors influencing car crashes through data cleaning and integration processes.

i) Topic / Question Description:
  Our group decided to investigate the factors influencing mortality rates worldwide. Each member focused on
researching different aspects of mortality rates and created a chart based on their findings. By exploring the
relationships between various factors contributing to mortality, we aim to provide a clearer understanding of the
causes of death. This knowledge can help people take more informed preventive measures to reduce mortality
rates.

ii) Stakeholders:
  The key stakeholders for this data include governments, citizens, and medical institutions. For
governments, mortality data is essential for enhancing public welfare and addressing specific causes of
death. For example, if diabetes-related mortality rate is high, governments can mitigate this by
strengthening nutrition regulations and enforcing changes in the food industry. Analysing mortality data
helps governments identify trends and correlations, enabling national-level interventions to ensure citizens'
safety. Furthermore, governments can learn from countries with lower mortality rates by adopting their laws
or cultural practices.
  For citizens, this data helps them understand common causes of death and take preventive actions. For
instance, if traffic-related mortality rates are high, individuals may drive more cautiously, use snow chains in
winter, or adhere strictly to road laws.
For medical institutions, mortality data provides critical insights for improving healthcare services. By
identifying the conditions most associated with diseases like cardiovascular disease, medical institutions
can focus their research on new treatments and develop relevant medical supplies. Additionally, if certain
diseases are linked to higher mortality rates, medical institutions can prioritise developing new vaccines or
therapies to address these health challenges.

iii) Data Overview:
  The dataset used for our analysis includes records of mortality rates globally, along with the information on
the year, continent, and specific country names. Each group member focused on different aspects of
mortality to ensure a comprehensive analysis of the topic from multiple aspects. Harry focused on the
relationship between adolescent birth rate and infant mortality rate, Seohyeon analysed the correlation
between infant mortality and UHC service coverage, Christian examined mortality rates related to suicide,
and Hein focused on maternal mortality rate. The dataset was sourced from various government records
and was simplified by Alan Fekete, who reshaped the data using Python, calculated derived values,
removed unnecessary columns, and eliminated rows with missing data. The key variables in the dataset
include Country, Year, Region, Maternal Mortality Ratio, and Proportion of Births Attended by Skilled Health
Personnel (%), among others. This dataset is well-suited for our research, providing the information needed
to identify trends and factors influencing mortality rate.





#ASSIGNMENT3

i) Topic / Question Description:
  Our group decided to predict Universal health coverage (UHC) service index worldwide. Each
member focused on different prediction models of Universal health coverage (UHC) service coverage
index and created a prediction model and result. By using various factors to predict Universal health
coverage (UHC) service coverage index, we aim to provide a clearer prediction of the UHC service
coverage. This knowledge can help stakeholders be more informed about the relationship between
services and other factors.

ii) Stakeholders:
  The key stakeholders for this data include governments, citizens, and medical institutions.
Governments can leverage the UHC service index predictions to evaluate the extent of essential
health service coverage within their countries, helping inform policy decisions. By analyzing predicted
UHC scores, governments can identify regions with limited healthcare access or high demand for
specific services, leading to more effective budget allocation, infrastructure expansion, and healthcare
workforce distribution. Additionally, they can benchmark their policies against those of countries with
higher UHC scores, adopting successful programs or strategies to strengthen their own health
insurance and service coverage systems.
  For citizens, they can benefit from understanding the level of the health insurance and service
coverages in their regions throughout the UHC index predictions. For instance, if a low UHC score is
anticipated in a particular area, individuals may choose to seek additional private health insurance
coverage or proactively gather information about health services that may not be fully covered. In this
way, UHC index predictions raise awareness, which enables citizens to better manage their own
health and ensure access to necessary care.
For medical institutions, the prediction data of UHC service index can anticipate which services will be
in high demand in specific regions, and develop appropriate programs or services to address these
needs. For example, if a region is projected to have a low UHC score, healthcare providers may focus
on expanding essential services or allocating additional support towards that area. Furthermore, by
understanding predicted UHC scores, medical institutions can enhance service quality and availability,
ultimately contributing to improved population health outcomes.

iii) Data/Model Overview:
  The feature we used for our prediction model is the UHC service index. Each group member focused
on different ways of machine learning models that predict the UHC service index to ensure a
comprehensive analysis of the topic from multiple aspects. Harry focused on Linear Regression model
and Polynomial regression model, Seohyeon used KNN model and Gradient Boosting regression
model, Christian used Decision trees for inside the Ed, and Random forest for outside the Ed and
Hein built logistic regression model and focused on pre processing techniques. The dataset was
sourced from various government records and was simplified by Alan Fekete, who reshaped the data
using Python, calculated derived values, removed unnecessary columns, and eliminated rows with
missing data.
